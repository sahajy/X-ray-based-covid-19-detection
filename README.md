# X-ray Based Quick COVID-19 Detection Using Raspberry Pi

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **rapid COVID-19 detection system** using **chest X-ray images** processed by a Raspberry Pi. It aims to provide an affordable, portable alternative to traditional PCR tests, especially useful in resource-limited settings.

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Fast diagnosis**: Detects COVID-19 patterns in chest X-rays within minutes
- **Portable solution**: Raspberry Pi-based system for field deployment
- **Cost-effective**: Uses affordable hardware components
- **Two detection methods**:
  - Custom-trained machine learning model
  - Pre-trained model integration (future implementation)
- **Real-time analysis**: Processes X-ray images on-device

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi (Model 4 recommended)
- X-ray sensor module
- Display unit
- Power supply

### Software
- **Python** (Primary language)
- **Libraries**:
  - OpenCV (Image processing)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (ML model)
  - NumPy, Pandas (Data handling)
  - Flask (Optional web interface)
- **OS**: Raspberry Pi OS

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. **Hardware Setup**:
   - Connect X-ray sensor to Raspberry Pi
   - Configure power supply and display

2. **Software Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/covid-xray-detection.git
   cd covid-xray-detection
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Detection System**:
   ```bash
   python src/detection_app.py
   ```

4. **Using the System**:
   - Capture chest X-ray image
   - System processes and classifies image
   - Results displayed with confidence percentage

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- Accuracy: XX% (on validation dataset)
- Detection time: < YY seconds per image
- Classes detected:
  - COVID-19 Positive
  - Normal
  - Other Pneumonia *(Optional)*

## ✅ Advantages
- **Rapid results**: Faster than traditional PCR tests
- **Reusable**: No disposable components required
- **Portable**: Can be deployed in remote areas
- **Cost-effective**: 1/10th the cost of commercial systems

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Requires X-ray machine for image capture
- Accuracy dependent on image quality
- Not a replacement for clinical diagnosis

## 🌟 Applications
- Rural healthcare centers
- Emergency screening at airports
- Mobile testing units
- Hospital triage systems
